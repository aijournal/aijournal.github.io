We still lack diversity in AI and is currently being practiced in only certain regions actively. This is one of many initiatives to bring more diversity to AI. More than 500 students and researchers from Africa and around the world visited this event.</p><p>Such initiatives greatly help in fostering local ML communities and making research knowledge more accessible. People are more exposed to cutting edge research and it gives them opportunities to visit conferences like NIPS (travel grant). Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@alienelf/an-open-letter-to-the-deep-learning-indaba-team-2723ec0ae0a8?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">open letter </a>to the Indaba Team which highlights the achievement of this initiative.</p><p>I truly believe that the benefits of AI can truly be realized only when it's not limited to some corporations/communities but when it's made publicly accessible (democratization). This is the only way to maximize the positive impact of AI.</p><p>This event was organized great set of researchers which includes Nando De Freitas (DeepMind), Jeff Dean (Chief of Google Brain), David Silver (DeepMind), Shakir Mohamed(DeepMind), Kyunghyun Cho (NYU) et al. as speakers</p><p>Jeff Dean talked greatly about exposing oneself to more diverse research. As per him, it's better to read more papers and gather more wider knowledge and inspiration rather than reading one paper in depth. </p><p>David Silver gave a talk on 10 Principles for Deep Reinforcement Learning. Sebastian Ruder has provided a nice summary of each slide in his this <a href="https://twitter.com/seb_ruder/status/1040235236284669952?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">thread </a>.</p><p>His talk revolved around how our RL agent should scale and this can be applied to common ML as well. </p><p>A list of Practicals also have been provided, <a href="https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-2018?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Here</a> .

It is named as "Everybody dance now" because it presents "do as i do" motion transfer approach, so what does that mean in a nutshell? If we have a source video of a person, like in this one, this person is dancing at this moment. After a few minutes of the target subject performing these standard moves, we can transfer these moves to a another target . This can be treated as as a per-frame image-to-image translation with usage of spatio-temporal smoothing. We can use these pose detections as an intermediate representation between source and target therby learning a mapping from pose images of the source to the target subject’s appearance. So we can perform transfer of motion between human subjects in different videos, we have source dancing in some place, and we can use those pose estimations and bring that to different target subjects.</p><p>Have a look at this for more details:</p><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vya2wOk26GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Link to research paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07371">arXiv</a>]</p><blockquote><em><em>Visit </em></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aijournal" rel="noopener nofollow nofollow noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener"><em><em>AI Journal</em></em></a><em><em> for more videos.

This paper compares different ideas and  methods that are used heavily in Machine Learning to determine what  works best. These methods are prevalent in various domains of Machine  Learning, such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4A76i6TOCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h3 id="transfer-learning-is-the-key">Transfer Learning is the Key</h3><p>Throughout  our work, we have tried to bring generalization into context, because  that’s what matters in the end. Any model should be robust and able to  work outside your research environment. When a model lacks  generalization, very often we try to train the model on datasets it has  never encountered … and that’s when things start to get much more  complex. Each dataset comes with its own added features which we have to  adjust to accommodate our model.</p><p>One common way to do so is to transfer learning from one domain to another.</p><p>Given  a specific task in a particular domain, for which we need labelled  images for the same task and domain, we train our model on that dataset.  In practice, the dataset is usually the largest in that domain so that  we can leverage the features extracted effectively. In computer vision,  it’s mostly Imagenet, which has 1,000 classes and more than 1 million  images. When training your network upon it, it’s bound to extract  features2 that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Initial layers usually  capture small, fine details, and as we go deeper, ConvNets try to  capture task-specific details; this makes ConvNets fantastic feature  extractors.</p><p>Normally  we let ConvNet capture features by training it on a larger dataset and  then modify. Fully connected layers in the end can do whatever we  require for carrying out classification, and we can add a combination of  linear layers. This makes it easy to transfer the knowledge of our  network to carry out another task.</p><h4 id="to-read-more-about-it-please-refer-to-this-original-paper-">To read more about it, please refer to this original paper:</h4><h4 id="using-transfer-learning-to-introduce-generalization-in-models"><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/part-1-using-transfer-learning-to-introduce-generalization-in-models" rel="nofollow noopener">Using Transfer Learning to Introduce Generalization in Models</a></h4><p></p><h4 id="also-transfer-learning-in-nlp-is-out-now-">Also Transfer Learning in NLP is out now:</h4><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxJJ0T54HX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><blockquote><em>Visit </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aijournal" rel="noopener nofollow nofollow noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener"><em>AI Journal</em></a><em> for more videos.
