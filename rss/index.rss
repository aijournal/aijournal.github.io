We still lack diversity in AI and is currently being practiced in only certain regions actively. This is one of many initiatives to bring more diversity to AI. More than 500 students and researchers from Africa and around the world visited this event.</p><p>Such initiatives greatly help in fostering local ML communities and making research knowledge more accessible. People are more exposed to cutting edge research and it gives them opportunities to visit conferences like NIPS (travel grant). Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@alienelf/an-open-letter-to-the-deep-learning-indaba-team-2723ec0ae0a8?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">open letter </a>to the Indaba Team which highlights the achievement of this initiative.</p><p>I truly believe that the benefits of AI can truly be realized only when it's not limited to some corporations/communities but when it's made publicly accessible (democratization). This is the only way to maximize the positive impact of AI.</p><p>This event was organized great set of researchers which includes Nando De Freitas (DeepMind), Jeff Dean (Chief of Google Brain), David Silver (DeepMind), Shakir Mohamed(DeepMind), Kyunghyun Cho (NYU) et al. as speakers</p><p>Jeff Dean talked greatly about exposing oneself to more diverse research. As per him, it's better to read more papers and gather more wider knowledge and inspiration rather than reading one paper in depth. </p><p>David Silver gave a talk on 10 Principles for Deep Reinforcement Learning. Sebastian Ruder has provided a nice summary of each slide in his this <a href="https://twitter.com/seb_ruder/status/1040235236284669952?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">thread </a>.</p><p>His talk revolved around how our RL agent should scale and this can be applied to common ML as well. </p><p>A list of Practicals also have been provided, <a href="https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-2018?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Here</a> . You can directly run them on Google Cloud which is super convenient. </p><p><strong>How to write a great research paper  ?</strong></p><p>Nando  de Freitas, Ulrich Paquet, Stephan Gouws, Martin Arjovsky, and  Kyunghyun Cho gave a session on how to How to write a great research  paper.

It is named as "Everybody dance now" because it presents "do as i do" motion transfer approach, so what does that mean in a nutshell? If we have a source video of a person, like in this one, this person is dancing at this moment. After a few minutes of the target subject performing these standard moves, we can transfer these moves to a another target . This can be treated as as a per-frame image-to-image translation with usage of spatio-temporal smoothing. We can use these pose detections as an intermediate representation between source and target therby learning a mapping from pose images of the source to the target subject’s appearance. So we can perform transfer of motion between human subjects in different videos, we have source dancing in some place, and we can use those pose estimations and bring that to different target subjects.</p><p>Have a look at this for more details:</p><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vya2wOk26GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Link to research paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07371">arXiv</a>]</p><blockquote><em><em>Visit </em></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aijournal" rel="noopener nofollow nofollow noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener"><em><em>AI Journal</em></em></a><em><em> for more videos.

This paper compares different ideas and  methods that are used heavily in Machine Learning to determine what  works best. These methods are prevalent in various domains of Machine  Learning, such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4A76i6TOCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h3 id="transfer-learning-is-the-key">Transfer Learning is the Key</h3><p>Throughout  our work, we have tried to bring generalization into context, because  that’s what matters in the end. Any model should be robust and able to  work outside your research environment. When a model lacks  generalization, very often we try to train the model on datasets it has  never encountered … and that’s when things start to get much more  complex. Each dataset comes with its own added features which we have to  adjust to accommodate our model.</p><p>One common way to do so is to transfer learning from one domain to another.</p><p>Given  a specific task in a particular domain, for which we need labelled  images for the same task and domain, we train our model on that dataset.  In practice, the dataset is usually the largest in that domain so that  we can leverage the features extracted effectively. In computer vision,  it’s mostly Imagenet, which has 1,000 classes and more than 1 million  images. When training your network upon it, it’s bound to extract  features2 that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Initial layers usually  capture small, fine details, and as we go deeper, ConvNets try to  capture task-specific details; this makes ConvNets fantastic feature  extractors.</p><p>Normally  we let ConvNet capture features by training it on a larger dataset and  then modify. Fully connected layers in the end can do whatever we  require for carrying out classification, and we can add a combination of  linear layers. This makes it easy to transfer the knowledge of our  network to carry out another task.</p><h4 id="to-read-more-about-it-please-refer-to-this-original-paper-">To read more about it, please refer to this original paper:</h4><h4 id="using-transfer-learning-to-introduce-generalization-in-models"><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/part-1-using-transfer-learning-to-introduce-generalization-in-models" rel="nofollow noopener">Using Transfer Learning to Introduce Generalization in Models</a></h4><p></p><h4 id="also-transfer-learning-in-nlp-is-out-now-">Also Transfer Learning in NLP is out now:</h4><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxJJ0T54HX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><blockquote><em>Visit </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aijournal" rel="noopener nofollow nofollow noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener"><em>AI Journal</em></a><em> for more videos.

An influential paper on the topic  has completely changed the approach to generative modelling, moving  beyond the time when Ian Goodfellow published the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">GAN paper</a>.</p><p>Why Wasserstein GANs are such a big deal:</p><ul><li>With  Wasserstein GAN, you can train the discriminator to convergence.

The big thing about WGANs is that developers can  train their discriminator to convergence, which was not possible  earlier. Doing this eliminates the need to balance generator updates  with discriminator updates.</p><figure class="kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M17D2j0QjoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h3 id="what-is-earth-mover-s-distance">What is Earth Mover’s Distance?</h3><p>When  dealing with discrete probability distributions, the Wasserstein  Distance is also known as Earth mover’s distance (EMD). Imagining  different heaps of earth in varying quantities, EMD would be the minimal  total amount of work it takes to transform one heap into another. Here,  work is defined as the product of the amount of earth being moved and  the distance it covers. Two discrete probability distributions are  usually defined as Pr and P(theta).</p><p>Pr comes from unknown distribution, and the goal is to learn P(theta) that approximates Pr.</p><p>Calculation of EMD is an optimization process with infinite solution approaches; the challenge is to find the optimal one.</p><figure class="kg-image-card"><img src="https://aijournal.github.io/content/images/2018/08/1-vl1T2Bo4o1XDGPiIJwwvLw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Comprehensive Guide to Generative Adversarial Networks and Wasserstein GANs"></figure><p>One  approach would be to directly learn probability density function  P(theta). This would mean that P(theta) is some differentiable function  that can be optimized by maximum likelihood estimation. To do that,  minimize the KL (Kullback–Leibler) divergence KL(Pr||(P(theta)) and add a  random noise to P(theta) when training the model for maximum likelihood  estimation. This ensures that distribution is defined elsewhere;  otherwise, if a single point lies outside P(theta), the KL divergence  can explode.</p><p>Adversarial  training makes it hard to see whether models are training.

As compared to  supervised learning, ConvNets have received little attention. Deep  convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) have certain  architectural constraints and demonstrate a strong potential for  unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets show  convincing evidence that a deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a  hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the  generator and discriminator. Additionally, the learned features were  used for novel tasks — demonstrating their applicability as general  image representations.</p><figure class="kg-image-card"><img src="https://aijournal.github.io/content/images/2018/08/aqe3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Comprehensive Guide to Generative Adversarial Networks and Wasserstein GANs"></figure><h3 id="problem-with-gans">Problem with GANs</h3><ol><li><strong>It’s harder to achieve Nash Equilibrium </strong>— Since  there are two neural networks (generator and discriminator), they are  being trained simultaneously to find a Nash Equilibrium. In the whole  process each player updates the cost function independently without  considering the updates of cost function by another network. This method  cannot assure a convergence, which is the stated objective.</li><li><strong>Vanishing gradient </strong>— When  the discriminator works as required, the distribution D(x) equals 1  when x belongs to Pr and vice versa. In this process, loss function L  fails to zero and results in no gradients to update the loss during the  training process. This figure shows that as the discriminator gets  increasingly better, the gradient vanishes fast, tending to 0.</li><li><strong>Use better metric of distribution similarity </strong>— The  loss function as proposed in the vanilla GAN (by Goodfellow et al.)  measures the JS divergence between the distributions of Pr and P(theta).  This metric fails to provide a meaningful value when two distributions  are disjointed.</li></ol><p>Replacing JS divergence with the Wasserstein metric gives a much smoother value space.</p><p>Training a Generative Adversarial Network faces a major problem:</p><ul><li>If  the discriminator works as required, the gradient of the loss function  starts tending to zero. As a process loss cannot be updated, training  becomes very slow or the model gets stuck.</li><li>If  the discriminator behaves badly, the generator does not have accurate  feedback and the loss function cannot represent the reality.</li></ul><h3 id="evaluation-metric">Evaluation Metric</h3><p>GANs  faced the problem of good objective function that can give better  insight of the whole training process.

WGANs make use of weight  clamping which gives them an edge and it which is able to give gradients  in almost every point in space.
